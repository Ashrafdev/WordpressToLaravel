# WordpressToLaravel

This package syncs post data from a wordpress.com blog to Laravel

NOTE: I'm working on getting this up for self-hosted Wordpress sites, and would welcome any help there.
The big issue in doing so has been trying to find an implementation that did not require any changes
to be made on the server which is hosting the wordpress site. I host my WP sites where I have root
access to the server, but I would love an implementation that would be of benefit to all those
who perhaps do not as well.
